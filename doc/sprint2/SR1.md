## Practices to continue
We like frequency of stand-ups, it allows the team to maintain focus and agility. And keep up to date with blockers.  

We will also continue our Git practices for reviewing and merging Pull Requests as we have seen our practices have prevented many bugs from getting merged. 

## New Practices
Starting now, we will incorporate a new methodology for getting tasks completed. We will now place a focus on the full completion of a story after progress has started for a story rather than complete a couple tasks for many stories at once. This ensures we don't have too many partially incomplete stories late into the sprint.  

Additionally, we will know have a text-only scrum meeting and 2 in-call meetings once a week rather than three in-call meetings a week since we found that 3 in-call meetings took up too much time and the text-only scrum would still allow us to catch up on any important updates from teammates.

## Harmful Practices to Stop
One practise we found harmful to our software development process was that we would spread our focus to multiple different user stories at once. This resulted in many stories being only partially completed late into the sprint when most stories only required a couple small changes to be completed.  

We also found that in many areas, we were adding in too much complexity rather than simplicity which really ate up our time. For example, in documentation, we originally decided to use SwaggerUI and Storybook but we realized halfway into the sprint that these technologies took too much time to properly maintain and update. We then switched to a simpler form of documentation with an md format which we found more effective.

## Best Experience
The best experience we had was when we created a release to wrap up sprint 1 and we got to demo and view the features and functionality that we put in so much hard work into creating. It was a joy to everyone seeing that the features we worked on were all working and up to our expectations because it proved that our hard work really paid off.

## Worst Experience
We originally decided to use SwaggerUI to document our backend but as we started documenting, we ended up realizing there was a steep learning curve to this software. The payoff to use it was not worth it considering the amount of time required to learn the SwaggerUI language. Unfortunately, a team member had spent a few hours of his time to realize the pain of cost of using SwaggerUI. In the end we went with a simpler method of documentation with an md format which we achieves the same goal and in turn is more accessible to view.
