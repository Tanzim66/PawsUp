# Process

## How did you organize the team?

When recruiting team members, we have decided to choose members by experience in Software Development. 
To keep the work load balanced, we have decided to form a team consisting of 3 members that have experience 
in Back-End Software Development and 3 memebers that have experience in Front-End Software Development.

Team Roles are divided as follows:
* Back-End Team:
    * Tanzim Ahmed
    * Steven Hans Limantoro
    * Krutik Tejalkumar Shah
* Front-End Team:
    * Payam Yektamaram
    * Tony Chen
    * Mark (LiangShu) Chen


Sprint Tasks are divided as follows:
* Tanzim Ahmed - Process.md, Summary.md, Personas
* Steven Hans Limantoro - Competition.md, Personas
* Krutik Tejalkumar Shah - Back-End Skeleton (setup)
* Payam Yektamaram - Summary.md, Personas, UI/UX prototype,
team-contract, Done.md, Front-End skeleton (setup)
* Tony Chen - Readme.md, UI/UX prototype
* Mark (LiangShu) Chen - UI/UX prototype
* Shared Roles: Product Backlog


## Which tools did you use, if any?
* The primary method of contact that we have agreed upon is Discord, which supports both messaging and voice calls.
 Discord allows us to form groups and organize the group into multiple channels, such as a front-end channel for 
 front-end related questions/answers and a back-end channel for back-end related question/answers. This keepswork 
 organized and easy to find for the respective team members. 
* Discord also gives us access to many helpful applications, such as discord bots. Using the discord calendar bot 
"Sesh", we are able to schedule events such as meetings by voting. It also notifies us on the time of the scheduled 
event to remind everyone of the event.
* Figma was used to design the UI/UX prototype. Figma gives us access to hundreads of UI templates that we are able 
to use to create the prototype for our project.
* Canva was used to create personas.

## How did you make decisions?
* When scheduled meetings, we had to make sure to pick a time when everyone is availabe. So, first we eliminated
all the possibilities where someone could not make it through discussion on Discord. Afterwards, we held a vote
on Discord to choose between the timings where everyone was available.
* When choosing a project to work on, we first collected all the information that we can find about the project
and listed them so that everyone can have an opinion on each project. Then, as a group, we discussed which
project seemed the most useful based on the information collected and if the project in question was able to
be completed within the time frame we have base on the level of experience that we have in Software Development.

## How frequently did you meet?
We hold meetings every other day of the week, typically at 8pm as voted by majority of the group. However, if
need be, we hold meetings during important informational events such as meetings with start up owners or in
the case a group member requests an urgent meeting.

Meetings:

* Sept 17th - Decide on which project we would like to work on, discuss requirements for sprint 0 and divide work
* Sept 20th - Discuss and decide on the tech used for Front-End Development and Back-End Development
* Sept 21st - Meet with product owners of PawsUp and discuss features of the application in depth
* Sept 22nd - Discuss and complete Product Backlog on Jira
* Sept 23nd - Review finished tasks and help others with their unfinished tasks

## How did you define priority and/or points of user stories?

Priority of user stories is defined using the following process:
* Meet with product owners and discuss the core features of the application and prioritize them first.
* Meet with team members and and argue which remaining features are vital to the application and makes application unique
    * Priotiry is given by strength of argument
* Prioritize stories that enhance user experience (for both customer and service providers)

## What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?
* Things that we have done well this phase:
    * A voting system on Discord to choose meeting times. This is important because not everyone lives in the same time zone,
    so we need to set times where everyone is able to make it to the meeting.
    * Having arguments over priority of user stories. Everyone has different opinions and it is worth listening to them 
    so that we can choose what is best as a team.

* Things we can do better moving forward:
    * Start as early as possible. Starting early not only ensures that tasks are complete on time, but also allows us to make time
    for refinement.
    * Divide work as early as possible. This ensures that no task is left untouched and everyone in the team has something to do.
