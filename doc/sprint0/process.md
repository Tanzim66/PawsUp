# Process

## How did you organize the team? Which tools did you use, if any?

* When recruiting team members, we have decided to choose members by experience in Software Development. 
To keep the work load balanced, we have decided to form a team consisting of 3 members that have experience 
in Back-End Software Development and 3 memebers that have experience in Front-End Software Development.
* Team Roles are divided as follows:
    * Back-End Team:
        * Tanzim Ahmed
        * Steven Hans Limantoro
        * Krutik Tejalkumar Shah
    * Front-End Team:
        * Payam Yektamaram
        * Tony Chen
        * Mark (LiangShu) Chen
* The primary method of contact that we have agreed upon is Discord, which supports both messaging and voice calls. 
Discord allows us to form groups and organize the group into multiple channels, such as a front-end channel for 
front-end related questions/answers and a back-end channel for back-end related question/answers. This keeps work 
organized and easy to find for the respective team members. Discord also gives us access to many helpful applications, 
such as discord bots. Using the discord calendar bot "Sesh", we are able to schedule events such as meetings by voting. 
It also notifies us on the time of the scheduled event to remind everyone of the event.
* Sprint Roles are divided as follows:
    * Tanzim Ahmed - process.md
    * Steven Hans Limantoro - competitions.md
    * Krutik Tejalkumar Shah - Backend Skeleton
    * Payam Yektamaram - personas, UI/UX prototype, team-contract, done.md, front-end skeleton
    * Tony Chen - Readme.md, UI/UX prototype
    * Mark (LiangShu) Chen - UI/UX prototype
