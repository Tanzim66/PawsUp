# Project Objective

Pawsup is an excellent service with an existing website, functioning backend system, and user base. However, we are worried about porting the features and functionality of the current website to an easy-to-use and intuitive cross-platform mobile app. We are not aiming to enhance the features or revolutionize the pre-existing service. Instead, we are trying to simplify and streamline the services Pawsup provides onto a mobile platform. 

# Key Personas

We have three primary personas; the customer, service provider, and admin.

## Sarah Gallagher - Customer

Sarah Gallagher, 26 years old, is the proud owner of a cat named "Milo" which means the world to her. When she isn't taking care of her most precious companion she is on the road giving presentations as the lead marketing director of Microsoft. She is constantly on the move and is always looking for a trustworthy caregiver for her best friend "Milo".

## David Cunningham - Service Provider

David is a 31-year old Toronto native and has been working as an animal care worker at Toronto Animal Services for over 15 years. David's greatest joy in life is taking care of pets. As an animal care worker, he trains, and feeds many different animals like cats and dogs. In his spare time, he often offers freelance services to take care of other people's pets. 

## Malcom West - Admin

# Key Scenarios
## Sarah Needs a Caregiver
Sarah has to travel out of the country for work to deliver a presentation. However, she is worried about her cat "Milo" because her friend Ashley who typically looks after Milo is out of town. Fortunately, she remembers that her friend John used this app called "Pawsup" to find an animal caregiver.

Sarah installs the app from the app store and creates an account. However, she notices that she has to upload government identification before she can book a service. This worries her a little but is re-assured as the app clearly outlines their top-notch protection of user data and fully encrypted data management practices. She uploads her identification and the following day is verified. She then books a service with a nearby caregiver that has received good reviews and ratings. The next day her request is approved by the caregiver and she drops her pet off later that day.

## David Wants to Look After Animals
David has nothing planned for the weekend and wants to put an advertisement out that he is offering animal caregiving services. David usually prints and posts flyers to attract customers however he hasn't been having luck with this strategy as of late. He remembers that his co-worker Bastel used to offer services on this app called "Pawsup". 

He installs the app from the app store and creates an account. He gains the ability to post on the services board after getting his account verified by uploading a piece of government identification. He makes a post that he is available to look after small and medium-sized dogs this weekend. The following day he opens the app and checks the messages section where he notices that he has several requests for his services. He approves all three requests and is super excited to take care of the animals.

# Key Principles

## Simplicity Over Pazazz
It is easy to get carried away when working on a project however it is vital to stick the product backlog and not add extra features that are not essential to the product. There is no need to overcomplicate things in hopes of impressing future users of the software. It is vital we satisfy user needs by providing the most simple application that can encapsulate all the project requirements.
