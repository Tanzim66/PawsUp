# Project Objective

Pawsup is an excellent service with an existing website, functioning backend system, and user base. However, we are worried about porting the features and functionality of the current website to an easy-to-use and intuitive cross-platform mobile app. We are not aiming to enhance the features or revolutionize the pre-existing service. Instead, we are trying to simplify and streamline the services Pawsup provides onto a mobile platform. 

# Key Personas

We have three primary persons; the customer, service provider, and admin.

## Sarah - Customer

When she isn't taking care of her most precious companion she is on the road giving presentations as the lead marketing director of Microsoft. She is constantly on the move and is always looking for a trustworthy caregiver for her best friend "Milo".
