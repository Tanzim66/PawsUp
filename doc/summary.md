# Project Objective

Pawsup is an excellent service with an existing website, functioning backend system, and user base. However, we are worried about porting the features and functionality of the current website to an easy-to-use and intuitive cross-platform mobile app. We are not aiming to enhance the features or revolutionize the pre-existing service. Instead, we are trying to simplify and streamline the services Pawsup provides onto a mobile platform.
