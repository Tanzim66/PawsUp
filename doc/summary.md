# Project Objective

Pawsup is an excellent service with an existing website, functioning backend system, and user base. However, we are worried about porting the features and functionality of the current website to an easy-to-use and intuitive cross-platform mobile app. We are not aiming to enhance the features or revolutionize the pre-existing service. Instead, we are trying to simplify and streamline the services Pawsup provides onto a mobile platform. 

# Key Personas

We have three primary persons; the customer, service provider, and admin.

## Sarah - Customer

Sarah Gallagher, 26 years old, is the proud owner of a cat named "Milo" which means the world to her. When she isn't taking care of her most precious companion she is on the road giving presentations as the lead marketing director of Microsoft. She is constantly on the move and is always looking for a trustworthy caregiver for her best friend "Milo".

# Key Scenario

## Sarah Needs a Caregiver
Sarah has to travel out of the country for work to deliver a presentation. However, she is extremely worried about her cat "Milo" because her friend Ashley who typically looks after her cat is out of town that weekend. Fortunately, she remembers that her friend John used this app called "Pawsup" to find an animal caregiver.

Sarah goes to the iOS app store and searches for the app. She instantly finds the app and installs it on her phone. After, making a Pawsup account she gains access to the nearby available services. However, she notices that she has to upload government identification before she can book a service. This worries her a little but is re-assured as the app clearly outlines their top-notch protection of user data and fully encrypted data management practices. She uploads her identification and the following day is verified. She then books a service with a nearby caregiver that has received good reviews and ratings from previous customers. The following day her request is approved by the caregiver and she drops her pet off later that day.
