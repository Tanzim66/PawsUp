## Unfinished Tasks
We have finished all our tasks for this sprint.

## Practices to continue
Similar to previous sprints, we like the frequency of our stand-ups, it allows the team to maintain focus, agility, and keep up to date with blockers.  

The new practice we incorporated last sprint of replacing one of the 3 voice scrums every week with a text based meeting has also saved our team members a bunch of time while still allowing us to catch blockers and communicate. So of course, we will continue this practice.

Similar to previous sprints, we will also continue our Git practices for reviewing and merging Pull Requests as we have been able to prevent many bugs from getting merged.  

## New Practices
We have identified a problem with our sprint planning during previous sprints. That is that there are some tasks that end up blocking many other tasks which we don't prioritize right away which ends up costing us delays. We have tried things out to resolve this issue but there is still a lot of areas we can improve on so we will continue to look into new practices to avoid these blockers.  

Something we wanted to incorporate last sprint but weren't able to due to unforeseen circumstances is having the backend team members work diligently at the beginning of the sprint to finish up tasks in order to allow the front end team members to finish up their tasks in a timely manner. We are looking to incorporate this practice to the best of our abilities in order to maximize our velocity.  

## Harmful Practices to Stop
In the last sprint we have attempted to address the problem of not completing tasks in the critical path as soon as possible however we still had some problems arise. Accordingly, we are going to continue to look into ways to stop neglicting major tasks that are blockers for many other tasks. This will hopefully allow us to prevent delays in our sprint and increase our velocity.  

Due to personal scheduling conflicts, some members have not been able to join some in voice scrum meetings, only being able to give a text based scrum message. Although these situations will happen, it is still in our best interest to avoid this as much as possible to ensure our communication is as good as possible.  

## Best Experience
Similar the previous sprints, the best experience we had was when we got to demo and view the features and functionality that we put in so much hard work into creating. We were even able to have a Pawsup member join and see the work we have done. Overall, being able to see the working app was very rewarding because it is basically like seeing your hard work come to fruition.  

## Worst Experience
Altough we tried to avoid this, we still had some backend tasks than blocked a lot of other tasks. We had tried to address this but still overlooked some areas which resulted in significant delays and this in turn led to some stories being completed only till near the end of the sprint. For example, front end tasks were unable to be completed until the corresponding backend tasks were completed. Again, this caused some rushing near the end of the sprint to get all the tasks completed, pushed, and finalized.
