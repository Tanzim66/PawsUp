 - BAC-89: Frontend update service workflow

## Practices to continue
Similar to last sprint, we like the frequency of our stand-ups, it allows the team to maintain focus and agility. And keep up to date with blockers.  

We also like the new format of our sprints where we also have a text based meeting a week rather than 3 voice scrums because it gives us back some time.  

Similar to before, we will also continue our Git practices for reviewing and merging Pull Requests as we have seen our practices have prevented many bugs from getting merged.  

## New Practices
Now that we are a few sprints in, we have realised a problem that affects our sprint velocity. That is that there are some tasks that end up blocking many other tasks which we don't prioritize right away which ends up costing us delays. We will now try to identify major tasks that are blockers at the beginning of sprints and prioritize them to prevent delays again.  

We also are going to have backend team members work diligently at the beginning of the sprint to finish up tasks in order to allow the front end team members to finish up their tasks in a timely manner.  

## Harmful Practices to Stop
We are going to stop neglicting major tasks that are blockers for many other tasks. This will hopefully allow us to prevent delays in our sprint and increase our velocity.  

We are still working on favouring simplicity over complexity. Applying this ideology in some aspects of this project will allow us to increase our sprint velocity.  

## Best Experience
Similarly, the best experience we had was when we got to demo and view the features and functionality that we put in so much hard work into creating. This time, we focused more on the actual product side of tasks and it was cool to see our vision coming to life. Seeing the features we worked so hard on fully functioning really makes the experience worthwhile.  

## Worst Experience
We had some backend tasks than blocked a lot of other tasks which we did not plan for well ahead of time and this caused significant delays and forced many stories to be completed near the end of the sprint. As one can guess, this caused a lot of rushing near the end of the sprint to get everything under control and this is something we have already made a plan for in order to prevent in future sprints.
