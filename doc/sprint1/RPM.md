## Release Goal
At the meeting, it was discussed that authentication/authorization and admin functionality was the main scope of the sprint and consequenctly was deemed the release goal.

The epic **Auth** (BAC-7) was prioritized as all issues under the epic were discussed to be vital to the sprint and would be the aim of the sprint.
Some of the important user stories discussed were the ability for users to create an account (BAC-1), log-in (BAC-2), log-out (BAC-22), and reset  password (BAC-3).

As a team, we also decided to prioritize the epic **Admin** (BAC-25). This includes the ability for users to upload their government identification for account verification (BAC-6).
Consequently, we also decided to prioritize the ability for an **administrator** to approve or decline user's requests for  verification based on their uploaded identification (BAC-41). 
Therefore, two epics were of main focus for our first sprint namely **Auth** and **Admin**.

The team also determined that the sprint velocity for our first sprint would be **34** story points. We first broke down each issue into subtasks and estimated each subtask in terms of hours. This then lead us to our planning poker session and from our backlog we picked the 6 most important stories for our first sprint based on our release goal.
